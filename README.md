# 🛳️ Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis

This project performs a quick and comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset.
It includes data inspection, visualization, correlation study, and basic insights.

## 📂 Features

- Load and inspect dataset (`info`, `head`, `describe`)
- Missing value detection + heatmap
- Histograms and boxplots for numerical features
- Correlation heatmap
- Pairplot of key variables
- Countplots for Survival, Gender, and Passenger Class
- Key EDA insights summarized

## 📊 Visualizations Generated

- Missing values heatmap
- Histograms of numerical columns
- Boxplots for outlier detection
- Correlation matrix
- Pairplot (Age, Fare, Pclass, Survived)
- Survival distribution by:

  - Gender
  - Class

## 📝 Key Insights

- Age contains missing values → requires imputation
- Females and first-class passengers show higher survival rates
- Fare distribution is right-skewed
- Pclass has negative correlation with Fare
